# Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed".
#  You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. 
# Every variable in Python is an object.

# Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and 
# floating point numbers(decimals). (It also supports complex numbers, 

myint = 7
print(myint)

myVar = 7.0

print(myVar)

# to make int into float 
myint = float(myint)
print(myint)

# Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.

myString = "Sachin"
print(myString)

my2ndString = 'Sharma'
print(my2ndString)
