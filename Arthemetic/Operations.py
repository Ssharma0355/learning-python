# Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:

helloWorld = "Hellow" + " " + "World"
print(helloWorld)

# Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:

multipylingString = "Sachin" * 5
print(multipylingString)

# Lists can be joined with the addition operators:

list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = ["Sachin","Sharma"]

print(list1+list2)
