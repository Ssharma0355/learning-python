# Lists are very similar to arrays. 
# They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. 
# Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.

myList =[]
myList.append(1)
myList.append(2)
myList.append(3)

# to print the index 
print(myList[0])

# to print the whole list with use of for loop 

for x in myList:
    print(x)
