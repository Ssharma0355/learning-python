# Boolean operators 

# The "and" and "or" boolean operators allow building complex boolean expressions, for example:

name = "Sachin"
age = 23
if name == "Sachin" and age == 23:
    print("Hi ",name)

if name == "Sachin" or age == 24:
    print("Heyy", name)

if name == "Sachin" and age == 24:
    print("Heyy", name, "nice to meet you")
